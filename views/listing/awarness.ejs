        <p>
          We focus on creating vibrant and interactive events by partnering with

          Activities like fun quizzes, street plays (Nukkad Nataks),
          competitions, and expert-led discussions—both online and offline—keep
          the audience interested and informed.

        <h4>Myth: Blood donation leads to weight gain or loss</h4>
        <p>Fact: Donating blood has no impact on your weight. The amount of blood taken during donation (about 450ml) is quickly replenished by your body without affecting metabolism.</p>
