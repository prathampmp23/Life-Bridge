      <h2>Why Do Blood Banks Charge for Blood?</h2>
      <p class="process-intro">
        Blood is donated freely by generous individuals, but delivering safe and
        usable blood to patients involves a complex process. Blood banks incur
        significant costs to ensure every unit is tested, processed, stored, and
        distributed safely. Here‚Äôs how it works:

          <h3>Donation</h3>
          <p>
            Volunteers donate blood at camps or blood banks, a selfless act that
            starts the journey.
          </p>

        <div class="flowchart-node" data-step="2">
          <div class="node-icon">üß™</div>
          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Each unit is rigorously tested for infections (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis)
            to ensure safety.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-arrow">‚ûî</div>
        <div class="flowchart-node" data-step="3">
          <div class="node-icon">‚öôÔ∏è</div>
          <h3>Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Blood is separated into components (red cells, plasma, platelets)
            for specific medical needs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-arrow">‚ûî</div>
        <div class="flowchart-node" data-step="4">
          <div class="node-icon">‚ùÑÔ∏è</div>
          <h3>Storage</h3>
          <p>
            Blood is stored in specialized refrigerators/freezers under strict
            temperature controls.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-arrow">‚ûî</div>

          <h3>Distribution</h3>
          <p>
            Safe blood is transported to hospitals, ready to save lives when
            needed.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="process-footer">
        These steps require advanced equipment, skilled staff, and constant
        maintenance, which is why blood banks charge a nominal fee‚Äînot for the
        blood itself, but for the life-saving process.

      <div class="impact-card">
        <h4>Emergency Care</h4>
        <p>
          Blood transfusions are vital for accident victims, surgical patients,
          and those suffering from traumatic injuries. A single car accident
          victim may require up to 100 units of blood.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="impact-card">
        <h4>Cancer Treatment</h4>
        <p>
          Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation often experience reduced
          blood cell production and require regular transfusions to maintain
          their health during treatment.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="impact-card">
        <h4>Chronic Conditions</h4>
        <p>
          People with blood disorders like thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and
          hemophilia depend on regular blood transfusions throughout their
          lives.
        </p>

      <div class="impact-card">
        <h4>Maternal Health</h4>
        <p>
          Postpartum hemorrhage remains a leading cause of maternal mortality.
          Readily available blood supply can be the difference between life and
          death for new mothers.

        <h4>Myth: Donating blood is painful and time-consuming</h4>
        <p>
          Fact: The donation process is nearly painless and takes only about 15
          minutes. The entire visit, including registration and refreshments,
          typically lasts less than an hour.

      <div class="myth-card">
        <h4>Myth: Donating blood weakens the donor</h4>
        <p>
          Fact: The body replenishes the fluid lost during donation within 24
          hours, and red blood cells are completely replenished within 4-8
          weeks. Many donors report feeling energized after donation.
        </p>

      <div class="myth-card">
        <h4>Myth: Blood donation leads to weight gain or loss</h4>
        <p>
          Fact: Donating blood has no impact on your weight. The amount of blood
          taken during donation (about 450ml) is quickly replenished by your
          body without affecting metabolism.
