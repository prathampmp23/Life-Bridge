      <p>
        Blood donation is a life-saving act that helps patients in need of blood
        transfusions. Every donation can save up to three lives, making it a
        powerful way to contribute to society.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you donate blood, you're helping accident victims, surgical
        patients, and those battling various medical conditions. The process is
        safe, simple, and typically takes less than an hour of your time.

              Donating blood saves lives and helps patients in critical need.
              One donation can save up to three lives. It also has health
              benefits for the donor, including reduced risk of certain health
              conditions and free health screening.

            <p>
              Most healthy individuals aged between 18 and 65 years can donate
              blood, provided they meet eligibility criteria such as minimum
              weight (typically around 110 pounds/50 kg) and pass a basic health
              screening. Specific requirements may vary by country and donation
              center.

            Is donating blood safe?

          <div id="answer3" class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, donating blood is very safe. All equipment used is sterile
              and disposed of after a single use. The donation process is
              conducted by trained professionals in clean environments. The
              average adult has about 10 pints of blood, and donating just 1
              pint is well within safe limits.
